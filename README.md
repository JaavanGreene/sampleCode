Eclipse Project Files - 12-3-12:      A project that I worked on in my Senior Project course. 
                                      The goal was to create a calculator that given some equation given by the user
                                      the calculator would output not only the correct answer but also the intermediate
                                      steps in solving said equation. It was able to do advanced algebra and trignometry
                                      as well as derive functions.
